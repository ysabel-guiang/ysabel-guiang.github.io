    <h3>Problem Solving</h3>

    <h4>Getting Blocked on a Simple Problem </h4>
    <p>
      One time I was getting mentally blocked over a simple code that involved a math problem. I had just solved a problem similar to it, but when I used the same technique, it wasn’t working. I used a variety of techniques to help me solve the problem. I tried to write down all the steps that I thought I had to do and I started to explain the problem out loud, as if I was explaining it to another person. I also tried to use a function (console.log) that would make the output visible. I also looked at the error message that came up and tried to work out what was wrong. Eventually I went back to the instructions and realised that I had interpreted the problem wrong. After, changing the code to what I was was instructed to do - it worked! 
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the process of getting stuck on this problem, I felt curious and determined. I wanted to know why approaching this particular problem was harder than the previous ones when the concept was the same. I felt like I had to be more creative in the way I had to solve the issue. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, I learned that I had to first understand what was being asked of me and read the instructions properly before trying to start solving the problem without a foundation. 
    </p>


    <h4>Solving a Problem in and Elegant way</h4>
    <p>
      There was this one problem that involved a multitude of steps. Before trying to face the problem, I tried to understand what was being asked of me. So I had a peek at the error messages that would turn up and try to get an idea of what I needed to do. After understanding the instructions, I attempted at solving the problem and was able to find the solution very quickly. Taking the time to understand the basic instruction, really paid off and ended up saving me a lot of time! 
    </p>
    <p>
      For this problem, I was trying to plan and understand the concepts though reading the error messages. I felt proud of myself for completing that challenge and understanding the issue. I learned that it’s a lot easier to solve problems and find solutions when you have a solid foundation of the basics and the instructions. 
    </p>


    <h4>Reflecting on Problem Solving Techniques</h4>

    <p>
      After completing hours of challenging code, I was able to use a variety of problem solving techniques and hone down my problem solving process. My personal favourites were reading the instructions/error messages, using console.log, trying something out and googling. I was able to solve most of the problems using these methods and am quite confident using them. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, with some of the more challenging codes, I would write out pseudocode, use the rubber ducky method and occasionally get help by peaking at the sample solutions. Since I used these less frequently, I am not as confident in using these methods. In this challenge, I did not end up reaching out to my peers or my coaches, which I would like to do a lot more of this in the future. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I had solved a problem, at times I would reflect on what I did to solve it and try to have a deeper understand on why the code worked and why it didn’t work in previous attempts. In understanding the problem better through reflection, I was able to apply what I had learned to future code.
