    <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>

    <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
    <p>Emotional intelligence encompasses a persons ability for self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy and social interaction. These skills can be learned and improved in order to progress in emotional intelligence. Self-awareness is the ability to recognise one’s emotions, thoughts, values, triggers and predispositions. It is about being aware and understanding about one’s self. Self-regulation is the ability to be able to regulate ones emotions. It is also about harnessing emotions to benefit the person. Empathy is the ability to understand another person and their situation. Social interaction is the ability to communicate with other people; both verbal and non-verbal.</p>

    <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
    <p>Emotional Intelligence is about a persons ability to communicate with ones self and others. IQ is a persons ability to perform mental and logical exercises. It involves a persons ability in language, memory, maths, reasoning, processing speed and visual-spatial processes. </p>

    <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
    <p>Emotional Intelligence is important because it involves the skills which are needed to communicate effectively with other people. As we are social beings, interaction is part of our day to day life. Possessing emotional intelligence allows for a person to be able to interact with others in a quality manner. </p>
