    <h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>

    <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
    <p>Neuroplasticity is the idea that the brain is able to be rewired depending on a persons thoughts, behaviours and environment. Understanding this concept will allow a person to realise that thought processes can always be changed when you want/need them to be as long as you adjust your thoughts/behaviours and environment. This is a huge benefit as people are able to adjust and rewire the thought processes to what they would like it to be. </p>
    <p>For me, understanding this concept of neuroplasticity, gives me hope that our thought patterns aren’t always permanent. We are able to rewire the way we think, behave and react to situations. I can use this to my benefit by working on the negative thoughts and behaviours that I would like to curb and replace with positive thoughts and behaviours. This is particularly important for my mental and emotional health, as I would like to rid my mind of thought distortions and excessive worrying. </p>
    <p>Some ways I would like to increase my neuroplasticity is through practicing to be more present in the moment and paying more attention to my thoughts. Being in the present moment and being one with my thoughts, I am able to pick up the negative thought processes in my head and replace them them more positive thoughts and self compassionate thinking. I am also trying to journal everyday, so that I am able to let my thoughts and feelings out and thus being more aware of the things I am thinking about.</p>
    <p><a class = "text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akoL5RAee9w&ab_channel=TEDxTalks">This</a> resource was really beneficial for me to understand neuroplasticity and how you can use it to positively effect your life.</p>

    <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
    <p>Growth Mindset is a way of thinking where you believe that you are able to learn and expand your knowledge though effort and challenges. Developing a growth mindset is relevant as you are able to continue to learn and grow through continuous effort and difficult situations. This mindset isn’t about believing that you are born to possess all the abilities you have, it is about working hard and being persistent so that you are able to possess the abilities you want.</p>
    <p>I found it interesting that is is possible to have both a growth and fixed mindset for different aspects of our life. You can have a growth mindset for learning and work but a fixed mindset for health and fitness. This was particularly surprising to me as I thought a person would have the same mindset for all aspects of their lives. However, as this was brought up, I looked into my own life and realised that I too have mixed mindset when it came to different areas of my life. </p>
    <p>I would like to incorporate a growth mindset to all areas of my life, particularly when it comes to learning. Instead of solely celebrating when I finish a task, I will start to celebrate when I have attempted at a task and made a good effort. Instead of seeing difficult challenges as blocks, I would want to see them as a necessary opportunity to learn and grow. In a sense, you may never learn how to change a car tyre if you haven’t broken down.</p>

    <h4>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset in relation to my Learning</h4>
    <p>These concepts of neuroplasticity and having a growth mindset can help me and how I approach learning. Instead of thinking that success is only achieved when you get things right and complete challenges and I instead think that success is when you make an effort at something and try your best. </p>
    <p>Challenges are catapults for growth and learning but only if you let yourself learn from them. I would like to see challenges this way and start seeing them as an exciting adventure. Through learning about neuroplasticity, I know that with time and practice, I will be able to think this way. Our minds are constantly changing and are growing in the areas that we cultivate it to grow in.</p>
