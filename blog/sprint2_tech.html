          <h3>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h3>
    </div>

    <p> In a webpage, different elements of the page can either be placed next to each other or on top of each other. In order to understand the different between inline and inline block, we first have to understand the different between block and inline.  </p>
    <p>A webpage is made out of multiple boxes placed strategically to create what you see on the screen.  </p>
    <img src="../images/Boxes.png" alt="image of of a webpage divided into boxes">

    <p>These boxes are either on the same line as each other or stacked on top/on the bottom of each other (vertically).</p>
    <p> Block display is when boxes are stacked vertically. Each box starts on a new line and no boxes are on the same line as each other. Think of block display as a one lane road. Cars travel behind each other, one after the other but are never side by side. </p>
    <img src="../images/Block.png" alt="image of boxes stacked on top of each other">
    <img src="../images/code block.png" alt="image of code for block display">

    <p>Inline display is when the boxes are on the same line as each other and are side by side. Each box starts right after the other on the same line. Think of inline display as a multi-lane road. Cars can travel right next to each other. </p>
    <img src="../images/Block and inline.png" alt="image of boxes in line with each other added">
    <img src="../images/code inline.png" alt="image of code for inline display">

    <p>Another difference between block and inline is that in block display you are able to change the height and width of the box. You can make the box bigger, smaller, wider and taller. However, in inline display, you generally arenâ€™t able to change the height and width of the box. </p>
    <img class="three-img"src="../images/Block and inline height.png" alt="image of stacked boxes getting bigger">
    <img class="three-img"src="../images/code shape block.png" alt="code of change in height for stacked boxes">
    <img class="three-img"src="../images/code shape inline.png" alt=" code change of inline block">

    <p>Now we know the difference between block and inline display, we can talk about inline block. </p>
    <p>Inline block is when boxes are able to be placed next to each other on the same line (like in inline) but these boxes are also able to change in shape (like in block). Inline block takes elements from the inline and block display functions to create a hybrid of both. </p>

    <img src="../images/code inline block.png" alt="code for inline block">
    <img src="../images/inline block change height.png" alt="boxes added changes in height">
