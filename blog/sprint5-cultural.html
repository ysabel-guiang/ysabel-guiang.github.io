    <h3>What I learned from Core Content</h3>

    <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have different mindsets in relation to different aspects of my life. I have both a growth mindset and a fixed mindset for different topics.</li>
        <li>I enjoy challenges to some degree and I like facing things that make my brain think. However, this isn’t equivalent to being stuck and trying the same thing over and over again.</li>
        <li>I celebrate my effort as wins and to see difficult tasks as learning situations. If I need more time on a task, that isn’t a failure - it’s a catapult for growth and learning. Success and learning isn’t equivalent to speed and output.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
    <p>
      Values, empathy and self-awareness is incredibly important for learning and programming. Establishing a healthy core is vital to being able to stay sane and persevere through all the learning and programming. Learning and programming can deplete the stores of the mind and body. The role of the core is to replenish the mind and body.
    </p>

    <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
    <p>
      I was surprised in how beneficial it was for learning how to code. It was able to help me keep a healthy mindset and not take myself too seriously and fall down into a mentally unhealthy mindset. It helped me to keep going in difficult situations and take breaks when I need to so that I can be productive when I get back to learning. Sometimes you need periods being unproductive so that you can be productive when you need to be.
    </p>

    <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
    <p>
      The most challenging part was to implement what I learned about neuroplasticity and growth mindset. Changing how I think and approach things is difficult and can take some time before it can become a habit instead of a conscious effort. 
    </p>

    <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
    <p>
      Web Development isn’t solely about the hard skills and the tech aspect. You can never seperate soft skills from any profession. It’s an essential part for any job and thus why we need to learn more about core skills and develop ourselves in that area as well. 
    </p>

    <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</h4>
     <p>
      No I don’t feel like is was a waste of time. I think It’s an essential part of learning and ends up helping the learner to learn better than they did before. It helps to put the learner in a healthy mindset so that they are able to handle the pressure and stresses of learning a large amount of content in a small amount of time. The harder the technical task, the more crucial it is to have core learning.
