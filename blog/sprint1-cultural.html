        <h3>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h3>

        <h4>Describe your core personal values</h4>
        <p>Some of my core personal values are spirituality, diligence, adaptability, openness and being principled. I have a deep inner life and often reflect on my spirituality, values and principles. I enjoy thinking deeply about things and finding the meaning behind something. The people around me describe me as someone who is very self-aware. I am also diligent and like to work hard. When I am assigned a task or am drawn to something, I will put all my effort to complete that task thoroughly. I’m naturally quite determined and have little trouble steering myself in the direction I want/need to go. My family see this in me and they are able to recognise the amount of effort I put into the things that are meaningful to me. I also have a certain degree of adaptability when faced with change and adversity. I like seeing adversity as a challenge and as an opportunity to grow. I try to take in as much as I can from a bad situation, move on from it and make it to my advantage. I’ve had to overcome a lot of drastic change and challenges in my life but I am thankful for how those events have shaped me. This trait is deeply connected to my openness, particularly to change and challenges. I welcome good change and challenges and am receptive to how I can grow from them.</p>

        <h4> Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took</h4>
        <p> One of the biggest ethical decisions I have had to make when I decided to stay or switch career paths. I was working as a Nurse and had dedicated four years of my life towards Nursing. I was drawn to Nursing because I wanted to help people and I wanted a career that would fulfil this purpose. However, working as a Nurse greatly impacted my mental, physical and emotional health. Within a year of working full time I had developed severe anxiety, insomnia and was constantly irritable. I was miserable most of the time and this impacted the quality of my life and my relationships. I then had to face the reality of my state and had to decide between staying in Nursing or changing into a different career. I thought about my values and how this would affect my decision. My spirituality and deep principles were more inclined to take the high road and live a life of martyrdom for the sake of ‘helping people’. However, I also realised that having a deep sense of spirituality doesn’t mean that I can abandon myself to the point of self-destruction. My value of being diligent made me not want to give up on Nursing and to keep on persevering but it also made me realise that my natural inclination to achieve would make it less difficult for me to switch careers. I also had to think about my adaptability and openness to changing career. I knew that in past situations I was able to grow and learn from change and use it to my advantage. My previous experiences gave me the confidence to take the risk and change career. Ultimately, it was the better decision as it allowed me to leave a situation that was negatively impacting not only me but the people around me. A short period of discomfort during the early days of a new career outweigh the lifetime of discomfort if I had stayed in Nursing. As a consequence of making this decision, I had to rely a lot on the people around me to support me while I was unemployed and trying to improve my health. Another consequence is that I had to start from the beginning all over again and go back to studying. </p>

        <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h4>
        <p>I was born in the Philippines but I grew up in New Zealand. The adults around me growing up were still very in tune with the Filipino culture. I would be surrounded by filipino culture at home and New Zealand culture at school and work. This resulted in me being a mix of these two cultures. Some aspects of filipino culture that I have integrated into my identity is my diligence and determination. Filipinos have a culture of working hard due to the harsh nature of Philippines. This is something that I have adapted into my working life. People in New Zealand are usually quite independent and reserved. These are some aspects that I have adapted into my own personality as I tend to be quite introverted and enjoy doing things alone/being alone. I can be open but at times also reserved. Filipino culture hold family very highly and this is something that it important to me as well. I am close with some members of my family and believe that they can be there for me no matter what. </p>

        <h4>Describe your strengths and limitations through explaining a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make</h4>
        <p>One decision that I had to make where I had to consider my strengths and limitations is when I had to pick my next career path. I was tossing up between Accounting and Software Development as those were two things that were interesting to me. I spoke to people who were in those fields and all of them noted that their careers had their own individual stresses and require hard work. A common theme that I heard from Accounting was that it can be busy but repetitive. From the Software Developers, they explained that they were rarely bored as they constantly had to learn new code and solve problems. Naturally, I posses a good amount of soft skills and am strong in empathy, intuition, spirituality and communication. These were beneficial for both paths. I also identified myself as determined, hard working, principled and passionate so I knew that I would be able to succeed in either career path. However, I also have a natural curiosity to challenge and adventure which means that I enjoy constant learning. I also had to think about my limitations as this would affect my decision. Some of my limitations were sensitivity, easily stressed, perfectionistic and self-depreciating. These limitations would negatively impact both of those careers if I let it. Another limitation that I had was that I was easily bored which meant that a repetitive and purposeless career would lead me to feel unfulfilled. Ultimately, after tossing up my strengths and weaknesses, I decided to go with Software Development. As a consequence of choosing this path I would have to be constantly learning and growing in my knowledge and career. Technology changes all the time and I have to keep up with it. </p>

        <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
        <p>My strengths in soft skills such as empathy, communication, intuition and spirituality allow me to grow and work with others. Entailing that it would be good for me to learn and develop my career alongside others in order for my strengths to come out. My determination and diligence will allow me to put in the work and persevere through the hard challenges and early days. My openness and curiosity to challenge is useful with learning. My limitation of being too harsh on myself can lead me to stop in my tracks. My overthinking and anxiety could also do this to me as well. This can make me more prone to burning out and giving up. Criticism can also sometimes make me feel disheartened and discourage me from learning and advancing.</p>
        
        <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h4>
        <p> My determination and diligence can help me in my learning journey as it allows me to be organised and finish all the content on time. It also gives me the drive to persevere through a difficult challenge. My soft skills allow me to easily work well with people and collaborate. This will help me a lot in learning as I want and can collaborate with others and work together. My openness and curiosity for challenge will allow me to see the joys in difficult situations and learn from it. The determination and diligence I possess may clash with productive learning as I may want to learn everything all at once, even if it is not essential for me. This would lead to a lot of wasted time and effort on my part. My empathy and intuition may distract me as I would be able to sense negative emotions from those around me and would not be able to concentrate on my own work.</p>

        <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</h4>
        <p>There was a time when I was working with my colleagues to help a patient. The patient needed to be moved unto another bed but was hesitating. I offered my help and there were five of us in total that were available. However, only three people were needed to do the job. Although it could be faster to complete the task with five people, there was some tension because the patient was being aggressive. This lead to emotions being riled up and the lead person raising their voice. They communicated that there were too many people there, so I didn’t take it personally and I removed myself from the situation to help improve the situation. The team was then able to complete the task with less tension as there were less people to manage. However, the person who raised their voice came up to me and felt like they needed to explain themselves to me even if I was not affected at all. Although this strategy worked in doing the job, I would communicate before I left that I was doing it to improve the situation and not because I was emotionally affected. This would allow for effective communication between team members.
