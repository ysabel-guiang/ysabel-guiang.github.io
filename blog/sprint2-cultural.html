    <h3>Learning Plan</h3>

    <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
    <p> A career pathway that I’m interested in entering is front-end web development with opportunity to dabble in some full stack web development. I would like to work for a company that fosters my growth and allows for me to continually lean new ways to code. I would like to work on projects that involve things that I’m interested in like finance, budgeting or planning. After a while, I would also like to work on projects that involve app development. </p>

    <h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h4>
    <p>Some of my strengths in relation to my learning is my time management and discipline. Planning things out and scheduling my days, allows me to learn consistently and not feel pressed for time. 
        I tend to be able to understand concepts quickly. If there is other concepts that I may not understand, I will find other resources that can help me. For the most part, I enjoy learning new things so it makes learning new skills enjoyable. I’m persistent when I’m learning new things and I keep wanting to attempt something till I can get something right. </p>
    <p>In terms of my limitations, I have some difficultly retaining everything I have learned if I don’t practice it often enough. I also have difficulty focusing and learning when my body is under stress (eg lack of sleep, illness). Sometimes I can get overwhelmed by all the content and I tunnel vision and am not able to focus and get tasks done. </p>
    
    <h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
    <p>I would like to develop assertiveness without coming off as impolite. This is in relation to communication in a team setting where someone may need to be spoken to in an assertive manner in order to get tasks done. </p>

    <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        <ul>
            <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
            <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
        </ul>
    </h4>
    <p>In order to manage my workload in this programme and in my professional life, I would make sure to manage my time wisely so that I can work consistently and steadily over a period of time. By planning my workload beforehand, I would be able to complete my tasks on time or earlier. This would reduce stress-levels before, during and at the end of a project. I would also communicate with my facilitator/team often so that they are kept updated with my progress and communication stays open. In order to do these things, I would first need to make sure I’m mentally, emotionally and physically healthy. Thus I would be making sure I am taking of my needs first and practice self-care. </p>
    <p>When things are building up and getting to me, I would communicate with my facilitator/team so that they are aware of my current state. I would also seek for help with my workload if possible, in order to find solutions/lighten my load. I would take more time to engage in activities outside of work that bring me joy and relaxes me. If my stress levels are being built up by a person in particular and it calls for confrontation then I would want to be open with them and talking things through civilly. </p>
      
    <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
    <p> When I stumped and need help I will try to seek help in a timely manner. First, I would assess the problem and create a plan to find a solution. If I am unable to find a solution at the top of my head, I would go back to the content/resources to find some information. If I’m still unable to find a solution through that, I would need seek help and write a post on the slack or ask my facilitator</p>

    <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>
    <p>I would like the facilitation team to give me constructive feedback on my progress and tasks eg what I could improve on and what I did good. If I’m falling behind or spending too much time on a topic that is not important, I would like the facilitation team to check up on me and remind on what I should prioritise. I would also like the facilitation team to give me insight on what I should spend more time learning and developing and what is not as necessary. It would also be nice to get some pointers on what would be a good skill to have in order to land a front-end or full-stack web development role.</p>

    <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h4>
    <p>I make sure to plan out how much of my day I would like to spend on learning. I tend not to go over that limit and make sure that I have time for other things. I always allocate evenings to spending time with my husband and doing things outside of learning so that I am not neglecting my personal life. I make a list of the things I need to do for the day and I always have some personal errands/time in there. </p>
