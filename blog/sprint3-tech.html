        <h3>JavaScript and The DOM</h3>

        <h4>HTML and CSS</h4>

        <p>HTML and CSS are essential elements of web development. They work hand in hard to display what we see on the page. HTML is the foundation of the page. You can think of HTML as the foundation and structure of the house. HTML provides the initial layout of what you see on screen. Similar to a house structure, it’s very colourless and standard. </p>
        <p>CSS on the other hand is what gives a webpage style and makes it aesthetic. You can think of CSS as the colour of the walls and doors. CSS adjusts the elements of the HTML home so that it can look more decorative. </p>
        <p>HTML can exist without CSS but CSS cannot exist without HTML. A plain house can be made without any decoration but you aren’t able to decorate a house if the house doesn’t exist!</p>

        <h4>Control Flow and Loops</h4>
        <p>Control Flow is the order in which code is executed. The way a code is written on a page will affect what order it will be executed in. It’s similar to how you plan things in your day at different times. For example, at 9am you go for a jog, at 12pm you have lunch and at 3pm you see your friend. First you will go for a jog, then you will havelunch and after that you will see your friend. The order in which you execute your tasks depends on what time you planned to do so. The earlier the task, the earlier it is executed. </p>
        <p>Loops are actions that continue to repeat instelf until it's signalled to stop. Loops are like when you boil water on a kettle. When the kettle is turned on, the temperature of the kettle continues to rise until the water reaches boiling point. Once the water reaches boiling point, the kettle automatically turns off. </p>

        <h4>The DOM</h4>
        <p>The Document Object Modifier, otherwise known as the DOM is what you can use on a webpage to edit it. On the DOM you can also see the code that was made to make the webpage and you can make edits to this code. </p>
        <p>An example of why you may want to use the DOM is when you want to change the size of a title on a webpage. When you change the size of the title, you are able to see the results straight away. </p> 
        <p> Being able to see results straight away, helps web developers to adjust a web page. However, these adjustments aren't permanent unless the DOM is linked to the original code.</p>
    
        <h4>Objects and Arrays</h4>
        <p>Objects are a list of different values that belong under one umbrella but have different properties. An example of an object would be a person. Lets say there was a person called Bella and she was 30 years old. Bella's hobbies are dancing and gaming. Bella would be the object and the values that would come under Bella is that she was 30 and she enjoys dancing and gaming. These values come under Bella but have different properties. The properties are 'age' and 'hobbies'. </p>
        <p>The way you access data from objects is that you first state the object, then state the property that it is in.  You can either state the property inside brackets [ ] or just use .(insertpropertyhere). </p>
        <p>Arrays are values that come under one umbrella and have the same property. An example of this would be fruit. Strawberries, bananas and mangoes are all fruit and share the same property. 'Fruit' would be the array and the strawberries, bananas and mangoes would be the values. </p>
        <p>An array is like a list where the first value is numbered 0, the second value is numbered 1 and the list goes on for the remaining values of the array. When you want to access data to an array, you state the name of the array and the number the value is in. The number must be put inside brackets.</p>

        <h4>Functions</h4>
        <p>A function is a block of code that can contain multiple tasks. Instead of trying to complete multiple tasks one by one, you can complete a function that can complete multiple tasks at once.</p>
        <p>You can compare it to making your own pancake batter vs buying a store-bought pancake mix. When you make your own batter, you have to put all the ingredients together one by one, which can take a lot of time. When you buy store-bought mix, the ingredients are already mixed together and the batter is ready to go - saving you a lot of time. The store-bought mix is similar to a function  - it saves times and is already formulated. </p>
        <p>Functions are useful because you are able to call on blocks of code without having to write it out again. This makes the code look neater and also saves time.</p>
